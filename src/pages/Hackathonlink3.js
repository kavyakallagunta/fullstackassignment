            <h4>Hybrid mobile apps are the new way to develop apps using HTML5 & Javascript and can deploy on multiple platforms like Android, iOS & Windows.

Cross-platform native mobile app development is usually resource intensive. When building a native app for various platforms, a plethora of programming languages as well as APIs and abstractions need to be understood and utilized. Hybrid mobile web apps offer a relatively inexpensive alternative to native apps based on a single codebase.PhoneGap makes this possible by wrapping open standard web apps in native code for all major smartphone platforms. This allows web development teams to build apps using their existing skills and tools, access native mobile device APIs directly from JavaScript, and package their web apps for sale in platform app stores.</h4>
